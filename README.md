# Bengaluru_House_Price_Prediction_Model

# Project definition:
The objective of the project is to create a machine learning model. We are doing a supervised learning and our aim is to do predictive analysis to predict housing price.
The problem we are going to solve in this project is the house price prediction problem. Based on certain features of the house, such as the location, area in square feet, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, we predict the estimated price of the house.

# Data collection :
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle.

# Model creation :
- The first step is data science work where we take a data set from Kaggle called ‘Bengaluru_House_price.csv’.We will perform some extensive data cleaning work on it to ensure that it gives accurate results during prediction.

- This jupyter notebook entitled ‘House_Price_Predictions.ipynb’ is where we perform all the data science-related work. Our dataset requires a lot of work in terms of data cleaning. In fact, 70% of the notebook is all about data cleaning where we drop empty rows and remove unnecessary columns that won’t help in prediction which is also called an outlier.

- The main packages used are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, pickle-mixin and sklearn.

# Deployemnt :
The web app has been build using basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flask and bootstrap.
